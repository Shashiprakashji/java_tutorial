# **Java Tutorial README**
Welcome to the Java tutorial repository! This repository contains various branches covering essential concepts in Java programming. Each branch focuses on a specific topic, providing examples, challenges, and exercises to help you learn and practice Java programming.

## **Branches**
### 1. Encapsulation
This branch covers the concept of encapsulation in Java, which involves bundling the data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit called a class

### 2. Classes Challenge
Test your understanding of classes in Java with challenges and exercises designed to reinforce your knowledge. Practice creating classes, defining methods, and using class inheritance to solve problems.

### 3. Constructor
Learn about constructors in Java, which are special methods used to initialize objects. Dive into different types of constructors, constructor overloading, and their role in object creation.

### 4. Polymorphism
Discover the power of polymorphism in Java, where objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass. Explore method overriding, dynamic method dispatch, and the benefits of polymorphic behavior.

### 5. Inheritance
Delve into the concept of inheritance in Java, where a class can inherit properties and behaviors from another class. Understand inheritance hierarchies, method overriding, and the use of superclass and subclass relationships.

### 6. Composition Challenge
Take on challenges related to composition in Java, where objects can be composed of other objects to achieve complex functionality. Practice creating composite objects and utilizing composition to solve real-world problems.

### 7. Burger Restaurant Project
Embark on a comprehensive project to build a burger restaurant management system in Java. Apply the concepts learned throughout the tutorial to design and implement a robust solution for managing orders, inventory, and customer interactions.

### 8. JDBC
Explore Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), which provides Java applications with the capability to interact with databases. Learn how to connect to databases, execute SQL queries, and handle database operations using JDBC.
